// SCM plans regional installation capacity from this, so two things matter:
//
//  1. It counts ONLY the confirmed physical-device portion of a requirement —
//     `device_qty`, the Quantity field inside the lead's Device service block.
//     It deliberately does NOT fall back to the generic `quantity` column the
//     way forecastUnits() does: that broader figure is the whole property
//     requirement, of which only part lands as hardware to ship and install.
//
//  2. It groups on each property's OWN state. A chain's properties can sit in
//     different states, and nothing here consults the chain's reference
//     location — `global_po_id` is never read.
//
// Scope: near-term installation load only, i.e. PO Expected onward. Earlier
// stages aren't committed hardware yet and would inflate regional planning.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
